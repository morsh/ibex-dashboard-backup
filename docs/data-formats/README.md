# Data Formats
Data formats are data transformers that align the data received from a data source to the format required by a visual component.

The available data formats are:

* [bars](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/bars.ts)
* [filter](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/filter.ts)
* [filtered-samples](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/filtered-samples.ts)
* [flags](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/flags.ts)
* [retention](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/retention.ts)
* [scorecard](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/scorecard.ts)
* [timeline](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/timeline.ts)
* [timespan](../../client/src/utils/data-formats/formats/timespan.ts)
